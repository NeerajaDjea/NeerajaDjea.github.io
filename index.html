            <p class="p1"> Hello, I am Neeraja and I have recently graduated as a Full Stack Web developer from the University of Birmimgham. On my path to becoming a web developer,I have learnt the MERN stack along with other popular web technologies. We not only had
                the opportunity to learn from the best instructors but also worked on projects collaboratively with our peers. Before deciding to become a developer, I have enjoyed being a primary school teacher which has a taught me a lot about time
                management, team work and goal setting. I have found that my true passion lies in coding ! With the skills I've gained coupled with my strong work ethic, I feel empowered to embark on a career in web based and mobile technology. You will
                find samples of my journey on project's page. It shows how much I have grown from the beginning of the course. You can click the links to see the deployed versions of my work or check out my code on GitHub.
