            <p class="p1"> On my path to becoming a web developer, I am currently learning to code at the Birmingham University. I am learning full stack, including the skills required to becoming a proficient front and back-end developer. The programme includes instruction
                in high-demand technologies and frameworks including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Java, Command Line and Git. We not only have the opportunity
                to learn from the best instructors but also work on projects collaboratively with our peers. The course is quite tough and challenging and testing my skills and doggedness, but I am thoroughly enjoying the challenge.

            </p>
            <p class="p1">From a technology novice to a someone who is able to code in 10 short weeks has been transformational. Once I complete the 6 month bootcamp, I believe I will feel empowered and be able to call myself a programmer! This instructional and highly
                interactive course is giving me the knowledge base and confidence to embark on a career in web based and mobile technology.
